# Getting to know peripherals with MSP430 programming
I blog at SistersLab. This repository contains codes for the MSP430 programming series for blog posts. I used Texas Instruments (TI) MSP-EXP430G2ET development board in this series. I have M430G2553 microcontroller on my board.

I started the series with this article [TI (Texas Instruments) LaunchPad ile MSP430 Mikrodenetleyicisi Programlamaya Giri≈ü](https://sisterslab.co/texas-instruments-launchpad-ile-msp430-mikrodenetleyicisi-programlamaya-giris/ )
